# Recycling
This project analyzes recycling data to identify trends and optimize waste management practices. Using Python and libraries such as Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn, the project processes and visualizes regional recycling rates. The analysis includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visual representation of recycling patterns across various regions. Statistical methods are applied to uncover key insights, with comparisons made between regions to assess the effectiveness of waste management programs. Based on these insights, recommendations are proposed for improving recycling practices and promoting sustainability.
